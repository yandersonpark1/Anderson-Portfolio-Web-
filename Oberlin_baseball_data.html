        <p>As a former collegiate pitcher, I was obsessed with everything in pitching from velocity, movement, mechanics, and especially data analytics.
            Using my research knowledge from industry leaders such as Driveline and Tread Athletics, I will offer insights showing how to individually improve pitchers while also improving an entire teams' staff. 
            All of the data will be based on research from biomechanical models, physics, excerise science, nutrition. 
            As baseball has aged, so has its competition; those without knowledge or refusal to utilize knowledge will only fall farther behind. 
            As a data engineer at SplashBI, I will work to create models and utilize data accessible and understandable to all. 
            I will also be featuring how to properly utilize data in a coaching environment and how when proplery utilized can enhance players performance.     </p>

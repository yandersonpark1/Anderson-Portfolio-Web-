                <!-- TODO: Write the about me -->
            <p> My name is Yongwoo Anderson Park. I am currently a sophomore at Oberlin College in Oberlin, OH. 
                I am pursuing a Computer Science and Data Statitics Major with a concentration in the pre-med track hoping to be a software engineer.
                I am passionate about designing algorthims and creating software that can help teams achieve their goals. 
                I belive as indiviudals we cannot accomplish much, but with the help of technology and a well organized team, the combination of skills can develop endless solutions to societies' problems.
                Professionaly, I have interned as a data engineer at SplashBI. During this time, I utilized and developed my skills with SQL, and Excel. 
                I was a member of the Oberlin College Varisty College Team as a pitcher. 
                I am now a pictching coach for the team as well as a data analyst and software engineer for the Data Department that I founded. 
                I am currently working to develop data models that pitchers can utilize to better understand their performance and implement pitch calling in game.

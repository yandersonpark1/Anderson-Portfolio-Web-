            <h1>About Me</h1>
                
            <p> 
                Hello, I'm Yongwoo Anderson Park, but everyone calls me Anderson. I am currently a sophomore at Oberlin College in Oberlin, OH pursuing a Computer Science with either a Data Statitics or Math Major.
                In addition to that, I have also completed a pre med track taking biology and chemistry classes along with their labs. 
                I am a dedicated software engineer using my skills as a programmer to handle data and problems that arise around me. Professionaly, I have interned and worked as a data engineer and software engineer at SplashBI. I created the data analytics department for the Oberlin College Baseball Team and am currently building a machine learning model to predict pitch outcomes and usability. 
                My curiosity and passion for learning has led me to take on many different roles and projects. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a person and as a professional, and hope to use this website to showcase my projects and talents. In addition, I will be taking the time to learn backend languages to finsih my skills as a backend engineer.
